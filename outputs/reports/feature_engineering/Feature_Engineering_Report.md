### Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive feature engineering strategy analysis and implementation for the AFL prediction model. We successfully analyzed four distinct feature engineering approaches, implemented a sophisticated pipeline, and created 123 engineered features from the original dataset.

### Feature Engineering Strategy Analysis

#### Strategy Comparison Results

We evaluated four feature engineering strategies across four key dimensions:

| Strategy | Predictive Power | Computational Complexity | Interpretability | Data Requirements | Weighted Score |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Traditional Statistical** | 3/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | **4.20** |
| **Advanced Time Series** | 5/5 | 2/5 | 3/5 | 2/5 | 3.40 |
| **Player Interaction** | 4/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 | 3.40 |
| **Contextual Features** | 4/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 | 3.60 |

#### Recommended Implementation Approach

**Primary Strategy**: Traditional Statistical Features (4.20/5.0)
- **Rationale**: Best balance of predictive power, computational efficiency, and interpretability
- **Implementation Priority**: Start with traditional features for baseline performance

**Hybrid Implementation Plan**:
1. **Phase 1**: Traditional + Contextual features (baseline + real-world factors)
2. **Phase 2**: Player interaction features (team dynamics)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced time series features (complex temporal patterns)

### Feature Engineering Implementation

#### Feature Categories Created

**1. Team Performance Features (Traditional Statistical)**
- Rolling averages (5, 10, 20 games) for goals for/against
- Recent form indicators (last 5 games)
- Season averages for goals for/against
- Home/away specific performance metrics

**2. Head-to-Head Features (Contextual)**
- Historical matchup statistics
- Win rates between teams
- Average goals in previous meetings
- Recent form in head-to-head matchups

**3. Player Aggregation Features (Player Interaction)**
- Team composition strength (aggregate player statistics)
- Experience metrics (games played, average experience)
- Star player impact (top performers)
- Team depth scores

**4. Contextual Features**
- Venue-specific performance advantages
- Rest days between games
- Time of season effects (early/late season)
- Historical venue experience

**5. Advanced Features**
- Feature interactions (polynomial terms)
- Momentum indicators (recent vs long-term performance)
- Volatility measures
