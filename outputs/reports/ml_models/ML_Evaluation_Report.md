2. **Monitoring**: Track winner accuracy, margin MAE, and calibration error
3. **Retraining**: Monthly updates with new season data
4. **Fallback**: Automatic switch to Traditional ML if Ensemble ML performance degrades

### Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Key Performance Indicators
- Winner prediction accuracy (target: >90%)
- Margin prediction MAE (target: <10 points)
- Calibration error (target: <0.1)
- Temporal stability (target: variance <0.01)

#### Alert Thresholds
- **High Confidence**: 80% probability threshold
- **Medium Confidence**: 60% probability threshold
- **Low Confidence**: 40% probability threshold

#### Retraining Schedule
- **Frequency**: Monthly with new season data
- **Trigger**: Performance degradation >5%
- **Validation**: Time series cross-validation
- **Rollback**: Automatic fallback to previous model version

### Risk Assessment

#### Model Risks
1. **Overfitting**: Ensemble ML shows perfect performance, may not generalize
2. **Data Drift**: AFL rules and team dynamics change over time
3. **Feature Availability**: Some engineered features may not be available in production

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Regular Validation**: Continuous monitoring of out-of-sample performance
2. **Feature Monitoring**: Track feature distribution changes
3. **Model Diversity**: Maintain multiple model versions
4. **Human Oversight**: Regular review of model predictions

### Conclusion

The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the Ensemble ML (Stacking) approach provides the best overall performance for AFL match prediction. However, the perfect performance metrics suggest potential overfitting, requiring careful monitoring in production.

The recommended deployment strategy involves A/B testing with Ensemble ML as the primary model and Traditional ML as a backup, ensuring both optimal performance and interpretability when needed.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement production deployment pipeline
2. Set up monitoring and alerting systems
3. Establish retraining and model update procedures
4. Conduct pilot testing with real-time predictions
