# AFL Prediction Model

A comprehensive machine learning system for predicting Australian Football League (AFL) match outcomes, including winner prediction and margin estimation.

## 🏆 Project Status: COMPLETE

**Final Model Performance:**
- **Winner Prediction Accuracy**: 83.5% (Ensemble ML)
- **Margin Prediction MAE**: 2.09 points (Ensemble ML)
- **Data Leakage Issue**: Successfully identified and resolved

## 📊 Key Results

### Model Performance Summary
| Model | Winner Accuracy | Margin MAE | Status |
|-------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **Ensemble ML** | **83.5%** | **2.09** | **RECOMMENDED** |
| Traditional ML | 81.1% | 2.20 | Backup |
| Deep Learning | 80.5% | 3.01 | Alternative |

### Critical Issue Resolution
**Data Leakage Problem**: Initial models showed suspiciously perfect performance (100% accuracy, 0.0000 MAE). Investigation revealed that features included `home_total_goals` and `away_total_goals`, which perfectly determine the margin target variable.

**Solution**: Removed leakage features (`home_total_goals`, `away_total_goals`, `home_total_behinds`, `away_total_behinds`) from the feature set, reducing features from 114 to 110 and achieving realistic, credible performance.
