## Critical Issue Resolution: Data Leakage

### Problem Identified
During initial evaluation, models showed suspiciously perfect performance (100% accuracy, 0.0000 MAE). Investigation revealed **data leakage**:
- Features included `home_total_goals` and `away_total_goals`
- Target variable: `margin = home_total_goals - away_total_goals`
- Perfect correlation (r = 1.0) between features and target

### Solution Implemented
- **Removed Leakage Features**: Excluded `home_total_goals`, `away_total_goals`, `home_total_behinds`, `away_total_behinds`
- **Feature Count**: Reduced from 114 to 110 features
- **Realistic Performance**: Models now show credible prediction accuracy
